# DataBases Project NTUA

  This is a project under the course of "Database Systems" in National Technical University of Athens in the 6th Semester.
  
  It aims to learn how to build a Database and use it for a Web Application, beggining with the E-R Model, convert it into a Relational Schema and finally built the Database in SQL.
  
  ## Getting Started
  In order to run the application, you must type (at cwd on bash) : `$ npm install` so as to sychronize the modules from the json.package.
  Then you should open Xampp and start the servers (or start the local MySQL service in your computer) and then type: `$ nodemon` or  `$ node app.js`. </br>
  **IMPORTANT!!** \
  You must check that in MySQL service (either on Xampp or locally) your credentials are **user=root** and **password=root**.   Otherwise edit the *./configuration/database.js* and put your credentials for the right connection.\
  \
  Now everything is ready! Type in your browser <http://localhost:3000> and the app is up!
